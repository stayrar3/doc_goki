In our previous chapter, Transaction State Account, we learned that the Smart Wallet Program stores all the details of a proposed transaction, including the actual instructions to be performed, in a special Transaction State Account. But how does the Smart Wallet actually perform those instructions? It\'s not like the Smart Wallet itself is a general-purpose computer that can just \\"do\\" anything.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction to Goki","description":"Goki is a project providing a multisignature Smart Wallet on the Solana blockchain. It acts as a secure, shared digital vault, allowing multiple designated owners to manage assets collaboratively. Transactions require a minimum number of approvals (threshold) and can include an optional timelock for added security, ensuring a delay before execution. The project includes a Smart Wallet Program (the on-chain contract) and a Goki SDK (a TypeScript toolkit) to facilitate easy interaction and management of these secure wallets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"owners-threshold":{"id":"owners-threshold","title":"Owners & Threshold","description":"Welcome back to the Goki journey!
